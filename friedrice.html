    <h2>Home-Made Fried Rice</h2>
    <p> Fried Rice can be made very simply! 
        one does not need to buy fancy sauces or other ingredients; 
        fried rice can be made to delicious with just rice, soy sauce, butter, and some (to taste) salt!
         for a bowl of fried rice to taste good the most important things are:
          1. Water content of the rice, most people cook rice with too much water. 
          for best results use a rice cooker. add 1.2-1.5 units of water per unit of rice 
          (most people use 2:1 ratio) the rice should be somewhat on the dry side, getting the rice to come out with the correct moisture content is 50% of the battle. and 2. cook a small enough portion of rice VERY hot for a short duration(2-4) minutes only!
        if you cook too large of a portion at once there will not be enough heat to give the rice its "fried" texture. That's it! everything else is secondary, add meats and flavors of your choosing, just be aware that too many meats and vegetables can ruin the texture during cooking aswell. it may be easiest to cook the meats and vegetable separately and add them when the rice is nearly done cooking. enjoy!

<h2>
    Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>cook rice to the correct pre-frying consistency, the grains shouldn't be sticking together too much.</li>
    <li>check the rice that it came out right, if it's too wet, you can still cook it, but it will have a nicer texture if you let the rice sit and dry out for a few hours or even overnight (leftover rice is great!)</li>
    <li>Mix the rice to be cooked into a container with a dash of soy sauce (if you have pre-cooked meat or vegetables or eggs go ahead and add them too if you want, just don't over-crowd the rice)</li>
    <li>Heat pan or wok very hot, oil should be beginning to smoke, likely use 100% heat depending on the strength of your appliances</li>
    <li>Dump rice in, stir and then flatten, be vigilant to prevent sticking, stir and flatten for 2-4 minutes</li>
    <li>It's done, enjoy your meal!</li>
